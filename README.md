# Object-Detection-Semantic-Segmentation-and-Instance-Segmentation
## Overview
This project focuses on advanced deep learning techniques for object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation using PyTorch and Detectron2. The primary challenge is to detect and segment planes in aerial images using the iSAID dataset. The project is structured in four main parts, each focusing on different aspects of deep learning in computer vision. You will evaluate your models by participating in a Kaggle competition, which provides an automatic ranking and evaluation system.

## Objectives:
### 1.Object Detection:
      - Improve upon a baseline object detection model to detect planes in aerial images.
      - Explore different data processing techniques, object detection methods, and hyperparameters to enhance model performance.
      
### 2.Semantic Segmentation:
      - Implement and train a neural network for the task of semantic segmentation.
      - Experiment with different network architectures, loss functions, and optimizers to improve segmentation results.

### 3.Instance Segmentation:
      - Combine object detection and semantic segmentation to perform instance segmentation.
      - Evaluate the model on a Kaggle competition and compare the results with different methods.
      
### 4.Mask R-CNN Implementation:
      - Utilize the Mask R-CNN model from Detectron2 and compare its performance with the custom models from the previous parts.
      - Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each method and discuss the results.

## Deliverables:
### 1.Code and Notebook:
      - A Jupyter notebook (lab3.ipynb) containing the implemented models, experiments, and visualizations.
      - The notebook should be well-documented and structured, detailing the process and findings.

### 2.Kaggle Submission:
      - CSV files with predicted test labels, uploaded to the specified Kaggle competition for performance evaluation.

### 3.Report:
      - A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, experiments conducted, and results obtained.
      - The report should include visualizations of training loss and accuracy, discussions on ablation studies, and comparisons of the different methods used.
